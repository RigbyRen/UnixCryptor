# UnixCryptor

Good day!

UnixCryptor - this program allows you to encrypt and decrypt the received data. 
It uses several encryption algorithms.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The user himself can choose what method he wants to encrypt the data.
Also, he can combine options or use all at once.


The file obtained as a result of the encryption has foure types of format.
1. file.gpg - if you use AES
2. file.cpt - if you use RIJNDEAL
3. file.cssl - if you use SSL
4. file.uct - if you use combined or mixed encryption

The program is still in the process of development. At the moment, the beta version
of the program is ready
